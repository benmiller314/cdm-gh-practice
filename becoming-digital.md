## Becoming digital


When the world was only analog, people lived in the moment, not rushing through life. 
Letters took time to send, photos were printed and held in your hands, and talks 
were face-to-face without distractions. Life was slower, 
and every moment felt more real and special.

When the world was only analog, puppies roamed freely. Frolicking through fields, and eating 
all of the treats they could ever ask for. It was a simpler time. 
Years later, cats came to destroy everything they once knew.

When the world was only analog, I was but a child. I never knew what the future held, but I knew we needed files.

When the world was only analog,
there was no knowledge. There was no joy.

When the world was only analog,
I would set a list of things I want to achieve, and make all the things into a way I hope it to be.

When the world was only analog, limitations roamed free.
People's imagination stuck in time with their means of expression.
The physical world of what is as opposed to what will be defined humanity.

When the world was only analog, 
people lived the same day over and over again. 
It was boring 
and nobody knew what to do with themselves. 
It was scary. 
Now there is change. 

If the world were only digital, the truth is assumed.
No physical evidence left behind.
Imagination is the only limitation known to man, and yet even in a world of endless possibilities, humanity falls short.
